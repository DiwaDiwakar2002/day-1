<p>A duck is a small type of swimming bird with a short neck and legs. 
They have webbed feet to help them swim and broad and flat bills, which they 
use to feed. They can live in freshwater or seawater and their feathers are 
waterproof! Male and female ducks often have very different appearances.
Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water. Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules and coots.
Ducks have amazing vision and are actually able to see in colour. A hen is a female duck, a drake is a male duck, and a baby duck is a duckling. Daylight affects the development of duck eggs. The ducks will lay more eggs as there is more daylight. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck" target="_blank"> see more... </a></p>
